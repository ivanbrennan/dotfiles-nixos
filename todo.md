> The file `~/.bash_profile` is read by bash when it is a login shell. That's what you get when you log in in text mode.
>
> When you log in under X, the startup scripts are executed by `/bin/sh`. On Ubuntu and Mint, `/bin/sh` is [dash](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Debian_Almquist_shell), not bash. Dash and bash both have the same core features, but dash sticks to these core features in order to be fast and small whereas bash adds a lot of features at the cost of requiring more resources. It is common to use dash for scripts that don't need the extra features and bash for interactive use (though [zsh](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Zsh) [has a lot of nicer features](https://unix.stackexchange.com/questions/983/what-features-are-in-zsh-and-missing-from-bash-or-vice-versa/985#985)).

> Most combinations of display manager (the program where you type your user name and password) and desktop environment read `~/.profile` from the login scripts in `/etc/X11/Xsession`, `/usr/bin/lightdm-session`, `/etc/gdm/Xsession` or whichever is applicable. So put your environment variable definitions in `~/.profile`. Make sure to use only syntax that dash supports.

> So what should you put where?
>
> * A good `.bash_profile` loads `.profile`, and loads `.bashrc` if the shell is interactive.
>     . ~/.profile
>     if [[ $- == *i* ]]; then . ~/.bashrc; fi
> * In `.profile`, put environment variable definitions, and other session settings such as `ulimit`.
> * In `.bashrc`, put bash interactive settings such as aliases, functions, completion, key bindings (that aren't in `.inputrc`), â€¦
